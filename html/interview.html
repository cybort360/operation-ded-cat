    <h1>CREATVIVE INTERVIEW TWO: <br />WIZARDS FATHOM OP_CAT</h1>
    <div class="interview-intro">
      <h2 class="interview-intro-header">An Interview for lay cats and wizards</h2>
      <p class="interview-intro-body">
        The ancient Oracles of Delphi said to ‘Know Thyself’ but it is surprising how many cats don’t know their own
        origins, this interview was conducted to help set the story straight. I conducted an interesting interview last
        week between two wizards who were discussing Quantum Cats, and I thought that today this excerpt might tickle
        your fancy for those trying to understand OP_CAT.<br /><br />
        My guests were El-Thor, the Grand Ordinal, who is legendary in Bitcoin circles and Rand, one of our novices who
        is studying for his first Ordinal in Wizardry School and hoping to get a pass with honors.

    <div class="interview-main">
      <h2 class="interview-main-header">Below is a transcript of the section on OP_CAT</h2>
      <p class="interview-main-body">
        <span class="rand">RAND:</span> So grand wizard I have heard some of the other neophytes talking about Quantum
        Cats and OP_CAT, but I don’t really know what they are, could you please explain it to me?<br /><br />
        <span class="el-thor">EL-THOR:</span> Of course, young RAND, you won’t remember when it all started but I can
        recall the time.<br /><br />
        <span class="rand">RAND</span>: Was it that far back grand wizard? <br /><br />
        <span class="el-thor">EL-THOR:</span> Oh yes, at least a decade ago, maybe more if my memory serves. I recall
        back in the early days a lot of things went on that caused all sorts of fuss and this was one of the fussiest,
        if you could call it that. You have heard of Satoshi Nakamoto?<br /><br />
        <span class="rand">RAND:</span> Of course grand master, everyone has heard of him – did you know him? <br><br><span class="el-thor">EL-THOR:</span>
        Well I did come across him a little, he was a mysterious chap … I doubt anyone knew him very well. <br><br><span class="rand">RAND:</span> What
        happened? <br /><br />
        <span class="el-thor">EL-THOR:</span> I’m getting to that my boy. As I said, way back in the days when a Bitcoin
        could be picked for a song, they wanted to do magical things with it. We had all sorts of inventions and debates
        going on – a bit like the wild west in my opinion, well I digress … it was a time of extraordinary achievement
        in coding and we saw the emergence of the unification of string in our ancient script, known as ‘OP_CAT’. This
        devilishly clever code was set for greatness but for a few small perceived flaws ..phah !<br /><br />
        <span class="rand">RAND:</span> What were they?<br /><br />
        <span class="el-thor">EL-THOR:</span> Some security concerns as I recall and Grand Master Satoshi felt it
        necessary to disable OP_CAT, this was sometime in 2010 as I recall.<br /><br />
        <span class="rand">RAND:</span> That’s sad … <br /><br />
        <span class="el-thor">EL-THOR:</span> Yes, but after all these years we have moved on and solved many of these
        problems, except perhaps for a few fellows where debates go on and on until the red candles appear. You know, as
        far as I am concerned, the rise of OP_CAT is now before us. <br /><br />
        <span class="rand">RAND:</span> There are Quantum Cats aren’t there? <br /><br />
        <span class="el-thor">EL-THOR:</span> Indeed my boy 3,333 of them. But innovation always wins out and behold we
        have the Genesis Cat the originator of all. <br /><br />
        <span class="rand">RAND:</span> Oh yes, everyone is talking about him .. or is it her? I don’t really know.
        Anyway, a fortune has been paid for the Ordinal. But I heard talk of missing cats in the dorm last night … what
        do you know about this grand master? <br /><br />
        <span class="el-thor">EL-THOR:</span> Well now, when the OP_CATS who resided in a magical land, finally woke up
        after all those years they formed two clans, those alive, and my personal favourite, those ded. Each clan had
        their own markings, a hint for you and your friends my lad - look to their eyes! These cats must make it through
        the trials of BIP Land, but first! - they must be found. They are missing and no one knows where they are.
        <br /><br />
        <span class="rand">RAND:</span> Do you know any more about these quantum cats grand master? Anything would be
        helpful. <br /><br />
        <span class="el-thor">EL-THOR:</span> I can tell you that these precious cats, who had not seen sunlight and
        food for more than a decade were keen to go on the prowl and so they up and left, just like that … without even
        a goodbye note to the wizards. Oh and I just remembered, these magical ordinals aren’t like the regularly
        inscribed ordinals, the cats themselves evolve over time, so who knows what they will become, it’s all very
        exciting. <br /><br />
        <span class="rand">RAND:</span> Definitely wonderful sir, but what should I do if I come across an OP_CAT?
        <br /><br />
        <span class="el-thor">EL-THOR:</span> Rand, if you or your friends see some exhausted wizards searching high and
        low for the missing OP_CATs, help them my young wizard! RAND: Thank you grand master .. if I find one of these
        valued cats, I will get them to the mint straight away. And so dear reader, if you have any questions or
        comments to make, please let us know. Perhaps you have seen an OP_CAT yourself? Until next week … Gmeow!
